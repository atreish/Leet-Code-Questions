# Leetcode: Top Interview Questions 

This repository contains the solutions to LeetCode's 145 Top Interview Questions (currently ongoing). All repsonses are in Python Jupyter Notebooks. The responses have been made by my Yeshiva University Colleagues Alejandro Parra-Garcis and Ruslan Gockman. For a full list of questions with greater description please see the link below.  

Note: All responses are typically functions, in Jupyter Notebooks. In the LeetCode platform, all responses are usually designed as a class solution. Most can easily translate to Jupyter but other times not. We've tried our best to include our responses as close as possible to the original and with as much explaination as possible.
